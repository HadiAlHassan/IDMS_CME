Boeing's chief executive Dave Calhoun will tell US lawmakers on Tuesday that he understands concerns about its safety culture after a mid-air emergency in January raised alarm.
In prepared remarks ahead of the US Senate sub-committee hearing, he said: "Our culture is far from perfect, but we are taking action and making progress. We understand the gravity."
The company has been in the spotlight since an unused door fell off a brand new 737 Max plane during a flight operated by Alaska Airlines, leaving a gaping hole in its side.
As part of an ongoing investigation, Boeing whistleblowers told the Senate in April that the 737 Max, the 787 Dreamliner and the 777 models had serious production issues.
Mr Calhoun, who has led the company since 2020, is expected to face tough questions about how Boeing responded when concerns were raised.
Ahead of the hearing, the Senate shared a report detailing concerns shared by whistleblowers in recent weeks, including allegations that the company had lost track of faulty parts, which staff sometimes tried to use in planes even after issues were identified.
The report said the accounts and other documents "paint a troubling picture of a company that prioritises speed of manufacturing and cutting costs over ensuring the quality and safety of aircraft".
Concerns about Boeing's attitudes toward safety and quality control conditions in its factories are not new, however.
The company faced intense criticism five years ago, after two 737 Max aircraft were lost in separate, but almost identical accidents, killing 346 people.
Mr Calhoun is also expected to apologise to the families affected on Tuesday in what will mark his first time giving testimony in front of the panel during his time as chief executive.
“We are deeply sorry for your losses,” his prepared opening comment says. “Nothing is more important than the safety of the people who step on board our airplanes."
