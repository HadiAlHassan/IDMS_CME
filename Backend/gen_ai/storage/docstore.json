Massachusetts, 180 U.S. 311\n\nCase Example: McDonald Case - Interpretation of habitual criminal statute\n\nLegal Proceedings:\n\n- Prisoner sentenced to additional punishment based on prior convictions\n- Separate proceeding for identification under the statute, not for establishing guilt\n- Opportunity provided to the prisoner to address the allegation of former conviction\n---\n#\n\n# Legal Document Details\n\n# Legal Document Details\n\nCase Summary: The document discusses the issue of prior convictions and the process of determining the identity of a former convict in a legal proceeding.\n\nKey Points:\n\n- The prisoner in the case did not contest the validity of previous judgments but claimed not to be the person convicted.\n- The document explains the practice of separately addressing the issue of former convictions in legal proceedings.\n- Provision is made for determining the identity of a former convict to prevent evasion of heavier penalties for repeated offenses.\n- The process of ascertaining prior convictions can be conducted through an information proceeding without the need for a new indictment.\n- Legal precedents and statutes from England and the United States are referenced to support the arguments presented.\n\nReferences: Plumbly v. Commonwealth, Regina v. Shuttleworth, Hurtado v. California, Brown v. New Jersey, Maxwell v. Dow, Ross's Case\n---\n#\n\n# Legal Document Details\n\n# Legal Document Details\n\nConsideration: Whenever a convict previously sentenced to confinement to hard labor for life or years is received into the State Prison, the Warden is required to report this to the Attorney General or Solicitor General for further legal action.\n\nCase Summary: The case discussed involves a convict named Ross whose term of imprisonment was increased based on prior convictions. The court clarified that the process was not for a new offense trial but to establish the fact of a previous conviction before imposing additional punishment.\n\nConstitutional Standpoint: The record did not mention whether prior convictions were known during the last indictment and trial, but this was deemed not crucial constitutionally. The State has the power to provide for the allegation of former convictions in the indictment but is not mandated to do so.\n\nEqual Protection of Laws: The plaintiff in error argued that the statute discriminates against former convicts by requiring an information process instead of an indictment solely based on their status of being in the penitentiary.", "mimetype": "text/plain",
